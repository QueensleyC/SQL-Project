# SQL-Project
This is a personal SQL project that I did during my training at Udacity

## Task
Investigate a Relational Database.
- __All four__ of your final submitted queries should contain a __JOIN__ and __AGGREGATION__.
- __At least two__ of your final submitted queries should contain either a __subquery__ OR a __CTE__.
- __At least one__ of your final submitted queries should contain a __Window Function__.
- __At least one__ column generated by the Window Function should be included in one of your final visualization.

## Presentation
- Four slides
- One question on each slide
- One visualization (graph / chart / table) per slide
- A 1-2 sentence answer to the question, based on the data and visualization, on each slide
- Indicate which code in the attached text file was used to create the visualization OR add the query used to generate the visualization.
